## What?
My personal guideline on freelance projects and personal projects

## Why?
From my previous experiences on freelance projects, having no written rules sometimes confuse what to do when certain situation happen. It makes me merge wrong branch, push wrong commits, and deploy wrong branch, and stuffs. This is good to improve the workflow. Rules are there to keep it right.
